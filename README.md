# tablist

This is a simple chrome extension that I created because I often end up with dozens of open tabs that I want to read later / keep for later reference.

The extension shows a list of all open tabs **in the current window** and allows the user to download an .html with links to all URLs. The .html has the favicons of the tabs embedded as a data-url so no network connection is needed for still being somewhat pleasing to the eye.

## Why not bookmark them?

As an .html file I can take them with me, send them to another device in a single file, index it with other software - basically do whatever I want without relying on syncing bookmarks across devices or re-exporting my bookmarks every other day. It's a cheap solution. In fact, typing this README is probably more effort than whipping up this extension. Oh and the icon. That took a few minutes.

## Change the icon maybe?

PRs are welcome :)

## Future plans for this formidable piece of software

As I'm using it in my day-to-day browsing, I'll probably add more features to it. The first thing that comes up is some way to only select a subset of the tabs for saving - you don't want to save google searches I guess?

## License

Apache License 2.0 for no good reason. I like it as a license. And hey, feels good to actively choose **something** the Apache foundation has come up with.

If you came here because you want to to sth similar, take a peek at the code but don't copy it verbatim. I'm not a JavaScript guru by any means, probably the exact opposite of that by any definition you can come up with. So. Look at it, admire it's clumsiness and then go out and smell a flower or something. Or not. The gist is: anything you can think of will probably be a better idea than copying this code. Oh, PRs are welcome, of course!
